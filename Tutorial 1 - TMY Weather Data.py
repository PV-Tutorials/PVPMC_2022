# # Weather Data & PV 
# 
# Weather and irradiance data are used as input to PV performance models.  
# 
# 
# ![SRRL](images/tutorial_1_SRRL.PNG)
# 
# 
# 
# These data are directly measured, derived from measured data, or simulated using a stochastic model.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 

# ## Typical Meteorological Year
# 
# TMY datasets are intended to represent the weather for a typical year at a given location. 
# 
# TMY datasets provide hourly ``solar irradiance``, ``air temperature``, ``wind speed``, and other weather measurements for a hypothetical year that represents more or less a "median year" for solar resource.  
#

# TMY datasets are created by selecting individual months out of an extended period of weather measurememts (say, 20 years of data) to construct a single year's worth of data.  There are several methods for selecting which months to include, but the general idea is to calculate monthly summary statistics and take the month that lies in the middle of the distribution.  For example, no two Januaries will be exactly the same, so summing the total solar irradiance for each January will give a bell curve, and the month that falls closest to the middle is chosen as the representative month.  The same process is followed for February, March, and so on, and all twelve representative months are stitched together into a year-long dataset.  
# 
# The oldest TMYs were calculated using data from the nearest weather station (air ports and such).  Today, it is common to use TMYs calculated using simulated weather data from satellite imagery because of the improved spatial resolution.
# 
# To get a better feel for TMY data, we'll first explore an example TMY dataset that is bundled with pvlib.

# #### First Step: Import Libraries

# In[11]:


import pvlib
import pandas as pd  # for data wrangling
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # for visualization
import pathlib  # for finding the example dataset


# Query which version you are using of pvlib:

# In[12]:


print(pvlib.__version__)


# ## Reading a TMY dataset with pandas
# 
# First, we'll read the example dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
# 
# We will use one of pvlib input-output functions: the .iotools.

# In[13]:


DATA_DIR = pathlib.Path(pvlib.__file__).parent / 'data'
df_tmy, _ = pvlib.iotools.read_tmy3(DATA_DIR / '723170TYA.CSV', coerce_year=1990)


# This dataset follows the standard format of handling timeseries data with pandas -- one row per timestamp, one column per measurement type.  Because TMY files represent one year of data (no leap years), that means they'll have 8760 rows.  The number of columns can vary depending on the source of the data.

# In[14]:


print("Number of rows:", len(df_tmy))
print("Number of columns:", len(df_tmy.columns))


# In[18]:


df_tmy.keys()


# 71 columns is quite a lot!  For now, let's focus just on the ones that are most important for PV modeling -- the irradiance, temperature, and wind speed columns, and extract them into a new DataFrame.

# # Irradiance 
# 
# Irradiance is an instantaneous measurement of solar power over some area.  For practical purposes of measurement and interpretation, irradiance is expressed and separated into different components.
# 
# ![overview irradiance](images/tutorial_1_DNIDHIGHI.PNG)
# 
# The units of irradiance are watts per square meter.  

# ### Wind
# 
# Wind speed is measured with an anemometer.  The most common type is a the cup-type anemometer, shown on the right side of the picture below.  The number of rotations per time interval is used to calculate the wind speed.  The vane on the left is used to measure the direction of the wind.  Wind direction is reported as the direction from which the wind is blowing.

# ### Air temperature 
# 
# Also known as dry-bulb temperature, is the temperature of the ambient air when the measurement device is shielded from radiation and moisture. The most common method of air temperature measurement uses a resistive temperature device (RTD) or thermocouple within a radiation shield. The shield blocks sunlight from reaching the sensor (avoiding radiative heating), yet allows natural air flow around the sensor. More accurate temperature measurement devices utilize a shield which forces air across the sensor.
# 
# Air temperature is typically measured on the Celsius scale.
# 
# Air temperature plays a large role in PV system performance as PV modules and inverters are cooled convectively by the surrounding air.

# #### Downselect columns 
# 
# There are a lot more weather data in that file that you can access. To investigate all the column headers, use '.keys'. Always go and read the Instruction Manual for the weather files to get more details on hwo the data is aggregated, units, etc.
# 
# We are interested in GHI, DHI, DNI, DryBulb and Wind Speed.

# In[17]:


# GHI, DHI, DNI are irradiance measurements
# DryBulb is the "dry-bulb" (ambient) temperature
# Wspd is wind speed
df = df_tmy[['GHI', 'DHI', 'DNI', 'DryBulb', 'Wspd']]
# show the first 15 rows:
df.head(15)


# ## Plotting time series data with pandas and matplotlib
# 
# Let's make some plots to get a better idea of what TMY data gives us.
# 
# ### Irradiance
# 
# First, the three irradiance fields:

# In[12]:


first_week = df.head(24*7)    # Plotting 7 days, each one has 24 hours or entries
first_week[['GHI', 'DHI', 'DNI']].plot()
plt.ylabel('Irradiance [W/m$^2$]');


# GHI, DHI, and DNI are the three "basic" ways of measuring irradiance, although each of them is measured in units of power per area (watts per square meter):
# 
# - GHI: Global Horizontal Irradiance; the total sunlight intensity falling on a horizontal plane
# - DHI: Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance; the subset of sunlight falling on a horizontal plane that isn't coming directly from the sun (e.g., the light that makes the sky blue)
# - DNI: Direct Normal Irradiance; the subset of sunlight coming directly from the sun
# 
# Later tutorials will show how these three values are used in PV modeling.  For now, let's just get a qualitative understanding of the differences between them: looking at the above plot, there is a pattern where when DNI is high, DHI is low.  The sun puts out a (roughly) constant amount of energy, which means photons either make it through the atmosphere without scattering and are counted as direct irradiance, or they tend to get scattered and become part of the diffuse irradiance, but not both.  Looking at DNI makes it easy to pick out which hours are cloud and which are sunny -- most days in January are rather overcast with low irradiance, but the sun does occasionally break through.
# 
# In addition to daily variation, there is also seasonal variation in irradiance.  Let's compare a winter week with a summer week, using pandas to select out a summertime subset.  Notice the increased intensity in summer -- GHI peaks around 900 W/m^2, whereas in winter the maximum was more like 500 W/m^2.

# In[11]:


summer_week = df.loc['1990-06-01':'1990-06-08']
summer_week[['GHI', 'DHI', 'DNI']].plot()
plt.ylabel('Irradiance [W/m$^2$]');


# ## Temperature
# 
# Next up is temperature:

# In[29]:


first_week['DryBulb'].plot()
plt.ylabel('Ambient Temperature [Â°C]');


# ### Wind speed
# 
# And finally, wind speed:

# In[28]:


first_week['Wspd'].plot()
plt.ylabel('Wind Speed [m/s]');


# ## Aggregating hourly data to monthly summaries
# 
# Pandas makes it easy to roll-up timeseries data into summary values.  For example, we can calculate total monthly GHI as a quick way to visualize the seasonality of solar resource:

# In[10]:


# summing hourly irradiance (W/m^2) gives insolation (W h/m^2)
monthly_ghi = df['GHI'].resample('M').sum()
monthly_ghi = monthly_ghi.tz_localize(None)  # don't need timezone for monthly data
monthly_ghi.plot.bar()
plt.ylabel('Monthly Global Horizontal Irradiance\n[W h/m$^2$]');


# In[ ]:





# We can also take monthly averages instead of monthly sums:

# In[39]:


monthly_average_temp_wind = df[['DryBulb', 'Wspd']].resample('M').mean()
monthly_average_temp_wind.plot();


# # Where to get Solar Irradiance Data?
# 
# There are different sources of solar irradiance data. For your projects, these are some of the most common
# 
# - TMY3/TMY2 - like the data we loaded earlier on this example, this database of .csv files kept by NREL is now deprecated. Use instead:
# 
# - [NSRDB](https://maps.nrel.gov/nsrdb-viewer/?aL=UdPEX9%255Bv%255D%3Dt%26f69KzE%255Bv%255D%3Dt%26f69KzE%255Bd%255D%3D1&bL=clight&cE=0&lR=0&mC=4.740675384778373%2C22.8515625&zL=2) - National Solar Radiation DataBase. You can access data through the website for many locations accross the world, or you can use an API* to download it. Free data. Resolution:
# 
# - EPW - available for many locations accross the world. It's in its own format file ('EPW') so you can't open it like an excel, but you can load it into a dataframe and use it. Not rigurous quality control - up to user. 
# 
# - pvgis - Costs. Commonly used in Europe.
#

# ### Fetching TMYs from the NSRDB
# 
# The example TMY dataset used here is from an airport in North Carolina, but what if we wanted to model a PV system somewhere else?  The NSRDB, one of many sources of weather data intended for PV modeling, is free and easy to access using pvlib.  As an example, we'll fetch a TMY dataset for Albuquerque, New Mexico:

# In[14]:


metadata, df_alb = pvlib.iotools.get_psm3(latitude=35.0844, longitude=-106.6504,
                                          api_key='DEMO_KEY',  # OK for this demo, but better to get your own key
                                          email='silvanaa@gmail.com',
                                          names='tmy')


# TMY datasets from the PSM3 service of the NSRDB are timestamped using the real year that the measurements came from instead of aligning everything to a single dummy year like the TMY file above. For convenience let's standardize it to 1990 and then compare monthly GHI to the North Carolina location:

# In[53]:


df_alb['Year'] = 1990
df_alb.index = pd.to_datetime(df_alb[['Year', 'Month', 'Day', 'Hour']])

ghi_comparison = pd.DataFrame({
    'NC': monthly_ghi,  # using the monthly values from earlier
    'NM': df_alb['GHI'].resample('M').sum(),
})

ghi_comparison.plot.bar()
plt.ylabel('Monthly GHI [W h/m^2]');


# It's not too surprising to see that our New Mexico location is significantly sunnier than the one in North Carolina.
